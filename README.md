Lukas's personal website built with Next.js and React.

This is the place where I share who I am, what I've worked on, and the skills I've picked up along the way.

The code here was written for my own needs and isn't meant to serve as a template for anyone else. You’re welcome to explore the repository and draw inspiration from it, but please note that it may not run out of the box without adjustments.
